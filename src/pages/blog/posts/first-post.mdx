## Introduction
A quadratic equation is an equation in the form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a ≠ 0. In this post, we'll create a simple Python program that solves quadratic equations by taking user input for the coefficients.

## The Code

```python
def solve_quadratic():
    print("Quadratic Equation Solver (ax² + bx + c = 0)")
    print("-------------------------------------------")

    try:
        a = float(input("Enter coefficient a: "))
        b = float(input("Enter coefficient b: "))
        c = float(input("Enter coefficient c: "))

        if a == 0:
            print("This is not a quadratic equation as 'a' cannot be zero")
            return

        # Calculate discriminant
        discriminant = b*b - 4*a*c

        if discriminant < 0:
            print("The equation has no real solutions")
            return

        # Calculate solutions using quadratic formula
        sqrt_discriminant = discriminant ** 0.5
        denominator = 2*a

        x1 = (-b + sqrt_discriminant) / denominator
        x2 = (-b - sqrt_discriminant) / denominator

        if x1 == x2:
            print(f"The equation has one solution: x = {x1:.2f}")
        else:
            print(f"The solutions are: x₁ = {x1:.2f} and x₂ = {x2:.2f}")

    except ValueError as e:
        print(f"Error: Please enter valid numbers")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {str(e)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solve_quadratic()
```

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The program prompts the user to enter three coefficients:
- a: the coefficient of x²
- b: the coefficient of x
- c: the constant term

2. **Validation**: The program checks if a = 0, which would make it a linear equation instead of quadratic.

3. **Discriminant**: The program calculates the discriminant (b² - 4ac) which determines the nature of roots:
- If discriminant < 0: No real solutions
- If discriminant = 0: One real solution (repeated)
- If discriminant > 0: Two distinct real solutions

4. **Solution Calculation**: Using the quadratic formula (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a), the program calculates the solutions.

## Example Usage

Here are some example inputs and their outputs:

1. **Two real solutions**:
```
Enter coefficient a: 1
Enter coefficient b: 5
Enter coefficient c: 6
The solutions are: x₁ = -2.00 and x₂ = -3.00
   ```

2. **One real solution**:
```
Enter coefficient a: 1
Enter coefficient b: 2
Enter coefficient c: 1
The equation has one solution: x = -1.00
   ```

3. **No real solutions**:
```
Enter coefficient a: 1
Enter coefficient b: 0
Enter coefficient c: 1
The equation has no real solutions
   ```

## Error Handling

The program includes basic error handling:
- Checks for invalid inputs (non-numeric values)
- Validates that 'a' is not zero
- Handles general exceptions that might occur during execution

## Conclusion

This simple Python program efficiently solves quadratic equations using the quadratic formula. It handles all possible cases: no solutions, one solution, or two solutions, and provides user-friendly output formatting.
