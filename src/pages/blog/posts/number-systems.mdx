# Guide to Converting Between Binary, Decimal, and Hexadecimal Systems

Converting numbers between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal systems is essential in computer science. This guide covers conversion methods for each system, including cases with fractional parts.

## Converting Decimal Numbers to Binary

### Method 1: Division by 2

1. Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. Record the remainder.
3. Repeat until you reach 0.
4. The binary result is the sequence of remainders read **bottom-to-top**.

```plaintext
Example: Convert 13 to binary:
- 13 / 2 = 6, remainder 1
- 6 / 2 = 3, remainder 0
- 3 / 2 = 1, remainder 1
- 1 / 2 = 0, remainder 1
Result (bottom-to-top): 1101

Method 2: Subtraction (Powers of 2)

Find the largest power of 2 less than or equal to the decimal number. Write a 1 in that position, then continue for each remaining position.

Example: For 13, powers are 2^3 (8), 2^2 (4), and 2^0 (1).
Result: 1101

Converting Binary to Decimal

Method: Sum of Powers of 2

Each binary digit represents a power of 2. Multiply each bit by 2^n where n is the position, starting from the right at n=0. Add the results.

Example: Convert 1101 to decimal:
1 x 2^3 + 1 x 2^2 + 0 x 2^1 + 1 x 2^0 = 13

Converting Decimal Numbers to Hexadecimal

Method 1: Division by 16

1. Divide the decimal number by 16.


2. Record the remainder, using hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F for values 10-15).


3. Repeat until you reach 0.


4. Read remainders bottom-to-top.



Example: Convert 254 to hexadecimal:
- 254 / 16 = 15, remainder 14 (E)
- 15 / 16 = 0, remainder 15 (F)
Result: FE

Method 2: Subtraction (Powers of 16)

Subtract powers of 16 to find the largest hex value in each position. This method is less common but helps with understanding computer processing.

Converting Hexadecimal to Decimal

Method: Sum of Powers of 16

Each hex digit represents a power of 16. Multiply each digit by 16^n, where n starts at 0 from the right. Add the results.

Example: Convert 2F to decimal:
2 x 16^1 + 15 x 16^0 = 47


---

Converting Binary to Hexadecimal

Method: Group in Sets of 4 Bits

Separate binary numbers into groups of 4 (from right to left), then convert each group to a hex digit.

Example: Convert 11011110 to hexadecimal:
Separate into groups: 1101 and 1110
1101 = D, 1110 = E
Result: DE


---

Converting Hexadecimal to Binary

Method: Hex Digit to 4-Bit Binary

Convert each hex digit to its 4-bit binary equivalent.

Example: Convert A.C to binary:
- Integer part: A = 1010
- Fractional part: C = 1100
Result: 1010.1100

Converting Decimal Numbers with Fractional Parts

If a number has a fractional part, like 6.2, we convert the integer and fractional parts separately and then combine them.

Decimal to Binary (Fractional Part)

1. For the integer part, use division by 2.


2. For the fractional part, multiply by 2 repeatedly, recording each integer result (0 or 1) as the next binary digit.


3. Stop when you reach a repeating pattern or acceptable precision.



Example: Convert 6.25 to binary:
- Integer part: 6 in binary is 110
- Fractional part: 0.25
  - 0.25 x 2 = 0.5 → 0
  - 0.5 x 2 = 1.0 → 1
Result: 110.01

Binary to Decimal (Fractional Part)

Each binary digit to the right of the decimal represents a negative power of 2. Multiply each bit by 2^-n where n starts at 1 from the right.

Example: Convert 110.01 to decimal:
- Integer part: 1 x 2^2 + 1 x 2^1 + 0 x 2^0 = 6
- Fractional part: 0 x 2^-1 + 1 x 2^-2 = 0 + 0.25
Result: 6.25

Decimal to Hexadecimal (Fractional Part)

1. For the integer part, use division by 16.


2. For the fractional part, multiply by 16 repeatedly, recording each integer result as the next hex digit.



Example: Convert 10.75 to hexadecimal:
- Integer part: 10 in hex is A
- Fractional part: 0.75
  - 0.75 x 16 = 12.0 → C
Result: A.C

Hexadecimal to Decimal (Fractional Part)

Each hex digit to the right of the decimal represents a negative power of 16. Multiply each digit by 16^-n, where n starts at 1.

Example: Convert A.C to decimal:
- Integer part: A = 10
- Fractional part: C x 16^-1 = 12 x 0.0625 = 0.75
Result: 10.75
